- 👋 Hi, I’m @unpronounceablepaul
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, coding, hacking, and the terrible mean New England Patriots!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github, AWS, HTML/CSS, and a little WordPress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above and any other interesting ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me:  paulunpronounceable@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Why does it have to matter?  As they say these days, "You do you...".
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm old.
